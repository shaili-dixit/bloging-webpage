    <pre style="color: white; font-weight: 600; font-size: 18px;">        I figure it’s probably important that I start off my posts with the background story of the Devika 
         we know today. I talk about her a lot, but I forget that not everyone knows what happened. She’s 
       changed a lot since then, we’ve seen her high-highs and her low-lows— but the one takeaway I would 
                want anyone to get out of her story, is to never give in, and to never give up. 

         Over the years, I’ve found myself retelling this story countless times. I was only a baby when 
       everything happened, so anything I describe from these early stages is purely taken from my mom and 
          sister’s retelling of the events. I’ve cried almost every time I tell this story, but now I 
         realize that Devika hasn’t cried even once. She lived through the worst part of it, and I’m the 
                                               one crying about it. 

          Our story begins on a summer weekend, when I was two and she was two weeks shy of her first
         birthday. We were just moving out of our house in Norwalk and into the new one in the Inland 
          Empire. Devika and I were both a little sick, leaving my mom to deal with not only moving, 
        but also with two thirds of her kids having fevers in the summer heat. Only, Devika stayed sick.
          Her fevers weren’t breaking, and she wouldn’t stop crying. A few days went by, and when they 
        realized the cold medicine wasn’t working, my parents took her to the hospital. In the emergency 
        room, the Doctors ran blood tests, and found irregularities. They decided on transporting her to 
       Loma Linda Children’s Hospital for further testing— my older sister, Meera, in the ambulance with 
         her, and my mom trailing close behind in the civic. I wasn’t there, of course, because I was 
                      still a toddler, and toddlers weren’t allowed in the ICU. 

         After taking another round of tests, her Doctors came to the conclusion that Devika had Acute 
         Myeloid Leukemia— a cancer in the white blood cell that, at the time, was more common in 40-50 
          year old Caucasian adults. It was an abnormal situation from its core. Even just the concept 
           of cancer was so foreign to my Mom and sister that they sat in disbelief for a few minutes 
                           before asking what their next steps would be. 

       Devika Chemo 1
         Devika didn’t leave the hospital for a year and a half after that. She spent her first birthday 
        in Intensive Care at the Pediatric Oncology Ward at Loma Linda. She spent it in a hospital crib, 
     surrounded by nurses and doctors, but not her sisters. I think about this a lot, and still feel guilty 
     about it, even though there was nothing Meera and I could do about it. The months went on, and after 
    the summer was over, I stayed with my Aunts and Uncles, and Meera had to go back home with our Grandma 
     Dadee and finish the eighth grade. My mom left her job at the bank to be with Devika full-time, and 
    my Dad worked extra shifts throughout the week to take care of the bills. To this day, I use this period 
        of our lives as a testament for what family really means, because even though everything in our 
     lives felt like it was falling apart around us, it was our family who helped glue together the pieces 
                   just enough for us to feel like everything might be okay.

      My aunt, Harsha, took a job at the local Montessori so that I could go there at a discounted price, and 
       took a job at the Foot Locker so that at the very least, even though my parents couldn’t buy me all 
      the toys I wanted, I could still rock a fresh pair of Jordan’s. My Aunts, Raju Mami, Arti Masi, my Fai 
       Sandy, Shashi Kaki, and the very pregnant Darshna Masi, made us dinner every night, got us clothes, 
      taught us right from wrong, and stepped in as my alternate Moms. My Uncle, Pritesh Mama, would try to 
        teach me how to read with his X Men Comics— while his younger brother, Sameer, would teach me 
      normal kid stuff, like how to convince our aunts to take us to the 7-11 for Coke Slurpees and Hot 
         Cheetos. My Aunt, Krupali Fai, would play boardgames with us to distract us when the adults 
       talked about changes in Devika’s treatment, and her parents, Dr. Tejura and Hansa Auntie, would 
    check in on Devika every day in the hospital. None of us could’ve predicted that this chubby little 
      ball of sunshine would be like the kids we’d see from those St. Judes ads on TV. We knew it was 
                         bad, but we never could’ve imagined it’d get worse.

    Devika’s Leukemia required a harsh round of Chemo treatments, that given the unique situation— was
     entirely experimental. My parents agreed of course, because our end game was to just get my baby 
      sister back home. Turns out, with experiments, comes risk. Devika’s brain began to react to the 
      massive amounts of Methotrexate in her chemo rounds, and because of that, she would experience 
    almost every side effect that comes along with chemotherapy. So, a baby who went into the hospital 
     for fevers and what we thought was an aggressive cold— ended up coming out year and a half later 
        with Mild Cerebral Palsy, Lennox Gestaut Syndrome, Mental Retardation, and Extremely Severe 
      Epilepsy. The Doctors told my parents to give up on her, because she’d never be able to walk or 
        talk again. One even joked with my Mom and told her it wouldn’t matter because she’d be a 
     vegetable anyway. The fucking audacity.  Well, my Mom doesn’t go down with a fight, and neither 
    does Devika. No one in my family does. I’ll talk about that later though, in “The One Where We Stick
                                            It To The Man.”

    So here it is, the one where Devika gets sick— the first time. In timespan of a year and a half, my 
  healthy little sister was changed forever. I’d also like to note that a lot of other things happened in
    this period, like my Grandmother’s Murder in Kenya, Meera’s life-saving Bone Marrow Transplant, the 
    birth of my baby cousin, Shivani, and the rewriting of our family dynamic. But, we grow through what 
       we go through, right? It wasn’t the first time my family had been through the wringer, and it 
    wouldn’t be the last. All I can say in reflection is that I’m entirely grateful to every individual 
  who helped us during that time— even the one’s I’m sorry to not have mentioned yet by name. I’m entirely 
             grateful because every single one of you has had an impact on who I am today. 

      Also, thank you to my readers for reading through my first post. I’ve got a lot of room for
    improvement, so I’m open to any and all criticisms you’ve got. HMU in the DM’s, and stay tuned for
                                      next week’s post. 

    Thank you thank you thank you. 

     With Love,

     Bika.
