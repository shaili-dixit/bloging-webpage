    <pre style="color: white; font-weight: 600; font-size: 18px;">          Just got in to this lovely city and in this most elegant Hotel - the old Palace of the Maharaja of Jaipur, 
            Rambagh. When I said last night that there is an air about Jaipur, it was both metaphorical and real.
            If I were to design a slogan for the city I may have constructed this -‘There is an air, in and about
                     Jaipur’. Did you get it ? There is an A-I-R in J-A-I-P-U-R !!
        
             You think maybe I have lost it ?? Or would you attribute this to extreme lack of sleep !! Ha ha ha
        
              Anyway the purpose of this early post was Shweta. Somebody wrote in on the blog to inform me, out
          of goodness, that Agastya Nanda had on his Orkut account names of his friends which were, according to him, 
                      not good company. So I checked with my daughter immediately.
        
        
              Agastya does not have an Orkut account. This is a spam account using his name. She also informed
                me that there was a similar spam account running on her daughter’s name, Navya. So, those that 
                are concerned, thank you for your information, but those accounts do not belong to Agastya.
        
               Shweta has been also deeply moved by the love and concern shown by all extended family on the 
                 condition of Agastya when he hurt himself and sent a response on the blog. For those that 
                               did not notice it, here it is - 
                Dearest Pa,
        
                 Been reading all the responses to your blog, am so overwhelmed with everyone’s prayers and 
                 concern over Agastya’s little mishap. I wanted you to thank everyone who has prayed for my 
                                  son’s recovery and wished him well…
                He is doing better and the wound is healing fast, no doubt as a result of all their prayers 
                                        and good wishes.
               He does indeed have a great capacity to take pain without complaining- he gets that from you.
              A couple of people asked what the meaning of his name was- Agastya was a great muni, revered in 
               the South…
               The literal meaning however is - one who never sets, hence is always in ascent.
        
               Goodnight, Sleep well (don’t stay up all night writing on the blog!)
               All my love
